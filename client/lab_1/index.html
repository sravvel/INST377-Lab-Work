<h2>Trying Out Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em> draw attention to something </em> in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
